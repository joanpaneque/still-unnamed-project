          <h3 class="font-semibold mb-3">When will VoiceGen launch?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-600">
            We're launching in March 2024 with limited beta access. Priority users get instant access,
            while free waitlist members get access within 2-4 weeks of launch.
          </p>

        <div class="bg-white border rounded-lg p-6">
          <h3 class="font-semibold mb-3">What's the difference between free and priority access?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-600">
            Free waitlist gets you in the regular queue with $1 credits. Priority access ($5) gets you
            instant access on launch day, $10 in credits, and priority support.
          </p>

          <h3 class="font-semibold mb-3">Does it really sound as good as ElevenLabs?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-600">
            Yes, we've done A/B tests with hundreds of users and 87% can't tell
            the difference. The quality is practically identical for most use cases.

          <h3 class="font-semibold mb-3">How much will it cost after launch?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-600">
            $0.15 per 1,000 characters with no monthly fees. That's about $1.50 for a 10-minute video
            and roughly $15/month for regular YouTubers - still 80% cheaper than competitors.
          </p>

        <div class="bg-white border rounded-lg p-6">
          <h3 class="font-semibold mb-3">Can I get a refund if I'm not satisfied?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-600">
            Absolutely. If you're not happy within the first 30 days, we'll refund your $5
            and you can keep the credits. No questions asked.
